    Hi, Jack here. In addition to the usual Saturday meetups I organize, I'm going to try showing up on Wednesday evenings at a bar in Medford with a few chess sets. It will be like our other meetups (all levels welcome, no registration needed) but just for grown-ups, and you'll need to make some sort of food or drink purchase from the business we're playing at. The next Pawns and Pints meetup will be Wednesday October 29 at Mrs. Murphy's (25 Salem St). I'll be there at 7:30 pm. Text me at (313) 410-6362 if you're having trouble finding us. As usual, please check this website for last-minute changes before heading out. Hope to see you drop by for a pint and a friendly game.
