    Jack is looking for members who can cover for him on the handful of days each year he can't make it to a Saturday meeting. Your responsibility would be limited to setting the boards up and putting them away; he can drop off and pick up the chess cart from your residence if that is easier. Let him know at (313) 410-6362 or elsey.jack@gmail.com if you can help.<br><br>
    
    The next club meeting will take place on December 7 from 1 to 3 pm at the Medford Public Library.
