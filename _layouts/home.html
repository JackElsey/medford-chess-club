    Hi, Jack here. In addition to the usual Saturday meetups I organize, I'm going to try showing up on Wednesday evenings at a bar in Medford with a few chess sets. It will be like our other meetups (all levels welcome, no registration needed) but just for grown-ups, and you'll need to make some sort of purchase from the business we're playing at. The first Pawns and Pints meetup will be this Wednesday October 8 at Ms. Murphy's (25 Salem St). I'll be there at 7 pm. As usual, please check this website for last-minute changes before heading out. Hope to see you drop by for a pint and a friendly game.
    <br>

    The following meeting will take place on Saturday October 11 from 1 to 3 pm at the Medford Public Library.
