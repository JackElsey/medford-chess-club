When I ask people at our meetings how they found out about us, people usually say it was via some web search that led to the page on Meetup.com. Maintaining our own website would be an order of magnitude less expensive, so after talking with the other organizers I've decided to cancel our Meetup subscription and put this site together. Content will continue to be posted on the Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/CheckmateMedford/), but in the future this is where you can quickly find information about our in-person events.
