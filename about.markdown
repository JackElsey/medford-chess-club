Drop by for a friendly game of chess in beautiful Medford, Massachusetts!

We have chess sets, chess clocks, and helpful members who are willing to teach you the rules if you're new to the game. There are no membership dues or fees to play. Aspiring chess masters of any age are welcome to play, although young children need to have a parent or mature older sibling present.

We currently meet every Saturday. If the weather is nice we play in the gazebo behind the Saltonstall Building at 121 Riverside Ave ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/yofzXWtNm7sn751X9)). If it's rainy or cold we'll play at the [Medford Public Library](https://medfordlibrary.org/).

There is usually plenty of parking behind Ebisuya Japanese Market at 65 Riverside Ave ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/NBdFAyDx35XGgK5N9)) or elsewhere in the square. If we're playing in the gazebo you may be able to get away with parking in the spots designated for the bocce ball court ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/5hdfY7DwLsYYUQ6L7)). **Please don't park in spots reserved for the Saltonstall Building residents! If there are complaints about us doing that we may not be able to play in the gazebo anymore.**

Contact Jack at elsey.jack@gmail.com or (313) 410-6362 with any questions.
